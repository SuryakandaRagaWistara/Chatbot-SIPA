The tallest mountain in the world could actually be in the USA, not Nepal. Learn about the different ways to measure the height of mountains and the contenders for the highest mountain in the world. Find out why Mount Everest, Mauna Kea and Chimborazo are all considered the highest in different ways. How do you measure the tallest mountain on Earth? Learn about the different criteria and contenders, from altitude to base to peak to distance from core. The highest peak in India and the third tallest mountain in the world at 28,169 feet, Kanchenjunga welcomes a maximum of 20 to 25 climbers annually—though 2019 saw a record 34.\n",
